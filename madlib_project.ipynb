    "Our bot is designed to prompt user input and then respond to that input in order to create a variety of Madlibs. The first part of our code creates a post on a subreddit that asks redditors to comment their responses to a randomly selected Madlibs outline. Then, our code can repeatedly parse through unread comments and check to see if the comment submissions match the desired format to fill in the Madlibs. If they don't, the bot responds with an error message. But if they do, the bot takes their answers and replies to their comment with the completed Madlibs story.\n",
    "\n",
    "After initializing the connection to reddit, the code block labeled \"POST\" can be run manually to create a Madlibs post from a set of randomly chosen Madlibs prompts. After that has been run, the code block labeled \"COMMENT PARSING\" can be repeatedly run to check for and respond to comments on the post created by the most recent run of the \"POST\" code block. \n",
